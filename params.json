It can briefly be described as a \r\nfield of philosophy or pseudoscience and its definition is often stated as:\r\n\r\n>...a supposed branch of philosophy or science that studies imaginary \r\n> phenomena beyond the realm of metaphysics; the science of imaginary solutions.\" \r\n> (‘pataphysics, 2015).\r\n\r\nJarry built upon his pataphysical concepts through several works over the course of his career \r\nincluding Ubu Roi, Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll pataphysicien \r\n(Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll Pataphysician), \r\nLa Chandelle Verte: Lumières sur les Choses de ce Temps \r\n(The Green Candle: Lights on things in this time) and César-Antéchrist (Caesar Antichrist). \r\n\r\nMany of the ides he and those who followed him are expressed in this tool kit\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\n###Anomaly\r\n\r\nAn anomaly represents an exception to the rule, that which disrupts the order of a system. \r\nAt its heart Jarry said ‘pataphysics is the law that governs exceptions.\r\n\r\nTherefore if ‘pataphysics sees the world as a collection of unique events surely an anomaly cannot exist? \r\nIt is here we find that the anomaly exists within the rule it contradicts. \r\nThus an anomaly within ‘pataphysics is an oxymoron and is the exception within the rule that renders the rule no longer a rule.\r\n\r\n###Antinomy\r\n\r\nThe term antinomy is used to define the mutually exclusive. \r\nAt its core it sums up symmetry and incompatibility. \r\nExamples are both plus and minus, good and evil black (the absence of light) and white (all the colours of the spectrum).\r\nIn Jarry’s Caesar-Antichrist it is represented by the physick-stick. \r\nIn an imaginary play acted out in this work the stick spins across the stage creating both a plus and minus.\r\n\r\n###Clinamen\r\n\r\nFor readers of Jarry’s work the most common clinamen they are likely to have come across is \r\n“merdre” derived from the French word merde (shit). Here we have a slight swerve away from the original word merde, with the addition of the ‘r’.\r\nThe experimental Canadian poet Christian Bök has summed up the definition of a clinamen as: \r\n“the smallest possible aberration that can make the greatest possible difference”. (Bök 2002).\r\n\r\n###Equivalent/Synonym\r\n\r\nThe equivalent is the synonym of two phrases. For example ‘ground’ and ‘land’ being synonymous. \r\nThe equivalent of course benefits from being similar, but not necessary identical. \r\nIn so much that two words can reference the same thing, but have a subtle difference in how a reader interprets them in the context of a sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Syzygy\r\n\r\nThe root of syzygy can be found in astronomy and refers to the alignment of three celestial bodies. \r\nThe Sun and Earth in conjunction with the Moon being an example of one of these alignments.\r\nOutside of astronomy it can be found in a variety of other fields including poetry and philosophy.\r\nIn ‘pataphysics it is used in the context of a pun resulting in something unexpected. An example being the name ‘pataphysics itself as we have seen.\r\nOther examples can be an unexpected result of a search. An example could be searching for the word “weed” and returning the word “band”.\r\nWhilst the initial search may have been meant in the context of an uncultivated plant growing in the garden, \r\nthe returning of the word “band” throws it into a different context. \r\nNow we have the initial word meaning drugs, and the search result being a reference to a rock band and the associated dug use or the prohibition of drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##References\r\n\r\n\r\nBök, C. 2002.
