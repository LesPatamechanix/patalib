PataLib for Python is a toolkt for implenting
pataphysically inspired algorithims.

A brief look at 'pataphysics
****************************

The following description is drawn from the paper:

"Investigation of a patadata-based ontology for text based search and replace" (Dennis, 2016)

The field of ‘pataphysics was founded in the late 19th Century
by the playwright Alfred Jarry. It can briefly be described as a 
field of philosophy or pseudoscience and its definition is often stated as:

"...a supposed branch of philosophy or science that studies imaginary 
 phenomena beyond the realm of metaphysics; the science of imaginary solutions." (‘pataphysics, 2015).

Jarry built upon his pataphysical concepts through several works over the course of his career 
including Ubu Roi, Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll pataphysicien 
(Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll Pataphysician), 
La Chandelle Verte: Lumières sur les Choses de ce Temps 
(The Green Candle: Lights on things in this time) and César-Antéchrist (Caesar Antichrist). 

Many of the ides he and those who followed him are expressed in this tool kit
including:

Anomaly
-------
An anomaly represents an exception to the rule, that which disrupts the order of a system. 
At its heart Jarry said ‘pataphysics is the law that governs exceptions.

Therefore if ‘pataphysics sees the world as a collection of unique events surely an anomaly cannot exist? 
It is here we find that the anomaly exists within the rule it contradicts. 
Thus an anomaly within ‘pataphysics is an oxymoron and is the exception within the rule that renders the rule no longer a rule.

Antinomy
--------
The term antinomy is used to define the mutually exclusive. 
At its core it sums up symmetry and incompatibility. 
Examples are both plus and minus, good and evil black (the absence of light) and white (all the colours of the spectrum).
In Jarry’s Caesar-Antichrist it is represented by the physick-stick. 
In an imaginary play acted out in this work the stick spins across the stage creating both a plus and minus.

Clinamen
--------
For readers of Jarry’s work the most common clinamen they are likely to have come across is 
“merdre” derived from the French word merde (shit). Here we have a slight swerve away from the original word merde, with the addition of the ‘r’.
The experimental Canadian poet Christian Bök has summed up the definition of a clinamen as: 
“the smallest possible aberration that can make the greatest possible difference”. (Bök 2002).

Equivalent/Synonym
------------------
The equivalent is the synonym of two phrases. For example ‘ground’ and ‘land’ being synonymous. 
The equivalent of course benefits from being similar, but not necessary identical. 
In so much that two words can reference the same thing, but have a subtle difference in how a reader interprets them in the context of a sentence.


Syzygy
------
The root of syzygy can be found in astronomy and refers to the alignment of three celestial bodies. 
The Sun and Earth in conjunction with the Moon being an example of one of these alignments.
Outside of astronomy it can be found in a variety of other fields including poetry and philosophy.
In ‘pataphysics it is used in the context of a pun resulting in something unexpected. An example being the name ‘pataphysics itself as we have seen.
Other examples can be an unexpected result of a search. An example could be searching for the word “weed” and returning the word “band”.
Whilst the initial search may have been meant in the context of an uncultivated plant growing in the garden, 
the returning of the word “band” throws it into a different context. 
Now we have the initial word meaning drugs, and the search result being a reference to a rock band and the associated dug use or the prohibition of drugs.
